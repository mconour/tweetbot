### TweetBot

TweetBot is a Python script that uses the Selenium library to automate interactions with Twitter. It allows you to log in to a Twitter account and like tweets containing a specific hashtag.

To use TweetBot, follow these steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries:**

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver
   from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
   import time
   ```

2. **Create an instance of the TwitterBot class:**

   ```python
   mc = TwitterBot('YOUR_USERNAME', 'YOUR_PASSWORD')
   ```

3. **Log in to your Twitter account:**

   ```python
   mc.login()
   ```

4. **Like tweets with a specific hashtag:**

   ```python
   mc.like_tweet('YOUR_HASHTAG')
   ```

Remember to replace `'YOUR_USERNAME'`, `'YOUR_PASSWORD'`, and `'YOUR_HASHTAG'` with your Twitter credentials and the hashtag you want to search for. This script will log in to your Twitter account and automatically like tweets with the specified hashtag.

**Note:** Please exercise caution when using automation scripts like this, as they should be used responsibly and in compliance with Twitter's terms of service.
